# Inf
I want to make a few iterations on the case when I physically have the PCB so for now it is just temporary to get the sizing right. 

I also need to review the firmware when I assemble the pcb. 

# Extra
- There is a option to add a level switcher to make the signalling better for the LEDs but for now I'm just going to bridge the pads and skip it.
